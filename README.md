## How to contribute?
### Pull Requests
We have two separate folders: `frontend` and `backend`. The names are fairly self explanatory. Clone our code and contribute server code to `backend` and app code to `frontend`. 
### Reporting Bugs
If you encounter any bugs, please let us know! Go onto the Issues tab on github and create a new issue, and let us know whatever you found!
